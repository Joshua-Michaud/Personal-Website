The changes I have made to my previous webpage is that it now uses Bootstrap. I have changed the
side navbar and implemented the dropdown bootstrap that will collapse as the screen gets smaller.
My text doesnt overlap each other, instead it will all shrink and get pushed 
down the screen. I have added a carousel to show what games I like to play. With bootstrap I have
essentially changed the structure and layout of my webpage to be responsive..
